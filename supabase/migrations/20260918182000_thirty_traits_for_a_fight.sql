-- Thirty traits for a fight, each with a roll of its own for the grade
--
-- Asked for: "add 30 combat traits that can roll on wildermon, each with its
-- own rarity roll as well". A plain trait is its tier: scrappy is common and
-- ironsides fantastic, so the tier roll and the trait roll were one roll.
-- Fighting blood is a name and a grade. The defs before this carry the
-- thirty names in all four tiers each (`trait_def.family` is the name the
-- four grades share) and four more channels for a fight: what a blow costs
-- it (`soak`), how often a swing at it lands (`evade`), how quickly its own
-- blows come (`haste`) and how fast its wounds close (`mend`). This is the
-- rules that read them, and the rolls that hand them out.
--
-- The rolls. `roll_trait` gives a share of the wild's rolls (`fight_share`)
-- to fighting blood: a name the animal does not already carry, in the grade
-- just rolled off the same wild odds as everything else, lifted by husbandry
-- the same way. `breed_traits` is crossed whole from the browser this time,
-- and with it two things the island never had: the chance of a trait coming
-- through a tier better than either parent had it, which is the whole of
-- why husbandry is worth having, and the top-up to three when the draw came
-- up short. Fighting blood climbs a grade of its own name; two grades of one
-- name are one name, and an animal never carries both. And the tier roll
-- itself was not the draw its weights describe (`random() / weight` hands a
-- rare one in sixteen, not one in nine); it is now.
--
-- The rules. A creature's blow (`creature_attack`) reads its `tough`, which
-- only its bite at a person did before; what a blow costs it (`wound_beast`)
-- reads `soak`; your swing and your arrow (`perform_fight`) read `evade`;
-- the three fight loops (`companion_settle`, `worker_settle`, `hunt_settle`)
-- read `haste` between blows; and its healing (`creature_settle`) reads
-- `mend`. Each through `beast_mul`, so a communal grade — a war leader, a
-- shield wall — lifts the herd the way a lead beast does.
