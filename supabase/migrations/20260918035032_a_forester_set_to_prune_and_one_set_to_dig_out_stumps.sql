-- A forester set to prune, and one set to dig out stumps
--
-- Asked from the island: wildermon foresters, set to prune; and a stumping
-- wildermon.
--
-- A species has one trade — a bevere fells — and a creature's `job` column
-- has only ever held that trade, written in when it was set to work. So a
-- species may now list the trades it can be set to, `species_def.trades`,
-- and the creature's `job` is whichever of them you named, or its own if you
-- named none. A bevere fells, prunes or digs out stumps. Every worker rule
-- reads `coalesce(c.job, d.gathers)` where it read the species, which is the
-- whole of the change to how a worker decides what it is.
--
-- A pruner prunes what would otherwise die: a stage that prunes back and
-- whose next stage has no life in it, off the age table, and nothing else —
-- a mature tree pruned stops bearing and a sapling pruned is a shrub for
-- good, and a forester set loose on a wood must not do either. A stumper
-- walks onto a stump and leaves bare dirt, as a shovel does. Neither carries
-- anything home.
