-- A rack whose footprint is what it carries
--
-- Asked from the island: a crate shelf taking two subtiles by four, holding
-- eight plank crates, drawn with however many of its spots are occupied.
--
-- The whole design turns on one choice: the rack holds nothing. A crate
-- standing on it is an ordinary crate at an ordinary subtile — the same row in
-- the same table, with its own contents, its own name and its own deed flag —
-- and the rack's eight subtiles simply *are* its eight crate spots. Two across
-- by four deep is eight, and a crate has always taken exactly one subtile.
--
-- That is why this migration adds no table and no column to `crate`, and why a
-- crate on a rack survives everything that already works on crates: hauling to
-- it, taking from it, a worker filling it, the deed crate, the lot. The rules
-- that change are the two that would otherwise be in its way.
--
--   * `crate_refusal`, which asks the earth whether a crate may stand on it.
--     On a rack's deck it asks the rack instead — the footing was answered for
--     when the rack was set down — and it will only take plank crates, which
--     is what the runners are spaced for.
--   * `fire_refusal`, which refuses to lift a piece of furniture with anything
--     in it. A rack has nothing *in* it however loaded it is, so that check
--     passes and the rack would come up out from under eight crates standing
--     on its deck.
--
-- `crates` on `furniture_def` is generated from `FURNITURE` in the browser
-- like every other thing a piece can be, so the number eight is written once.
