-- Every worker on every island has been standing still.
--
-- Reported as "Rabba refusing to work": a rabba set to forage a deed, standing
-- at the token, its card reading "Looking for work" and the crate staying
-- empty. The rules were not refusing anything. Nothing was asking them.
--
-- `worker_settle` is the whole of a worker's day — find a tile, walk to it,
-- work it, carry it home — and it had exactly one caller: `creature_settle`,
-- which ran it at the end of settling the body. Slowing wild wandering meant
-- re-emitting `creature_settle`, and the re-emission came back without those
-- two lines. Nothing in the database has called `worker_settle` since:
--
--     select p.proname from pg_proc p ... where p.prosrc like '%worker_settle(%'
--     (0 rows)
--
-- So a worker was assigned, told it would forage within eight tiles of the
-- token, filed under the deed, counted against the cap — and never once asked
-- to do anything. `creature_sweep` walked its body forward, its hunger fell,
-- and that was the entire extent of its employment.
--
-- The suite did not catch it because every worker measurement in it calls
-- `worker_settle` by hand. Thirty-six rounds of foraging, a skill from 1 to
-- 8.37, a full crate — all true, and none of it reachable from outside. Two
-- measurements go in with this: one that runs a forager through
-- `creature_sweep`, which is the door the island actually opens, and one that
-- simply counts the callers, because "the rules work and nothing calls them"
-- is a shape this project has now hit twice.
