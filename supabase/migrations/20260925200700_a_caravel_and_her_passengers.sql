/*
 * A caravel, and the people she carries.
 *
 * Asked for: "Raise ship costs dramatically too. Add a caravel that is larger
 * and costs at least 3x sailboat. Can have 3 passengers and carry 5000 items".
 *
 * The bills, the hold and the hull are definitions and came over with them:
 * the rowing boat and the sailing boat cost more, and the caravel is a new
 * hull on a whole tile with every line of her bill at least three times the
 * sailing boat's and a hold of five thousand things. `boat_def.passengers`
 * says how many people a hull carries besides whoever has her helm -- three
 * for the caravel, none for the rest.
 *
 * What was not there at all was a passenger. A hull had one body in it, the
 * one steering. Now:
 *
 *   board_passenger  comes aboard from beside her, into the first free place
 *                    on her deck, while she is afloat and a place is free;
 *   leave_passenger  steps ashore onto the nearest dry ground, and only when
 *                    there is some within reach;
 *   board_vehicle    from a place on her deck takes an empty helm without
 *                    having to stand beside her, and hands a helmsman who has
 *                    gone away the place it leaves -- so nobody is left in the
 *                    sea behind her. And a helm somebody present is holding
 *                    is theirs: this used to hand it to whoever asked.
 *
 * `player.aboard` is the hull and `player.seat` the place. While aboard, a
 * body goes where she goes: `drag_along` moves passengers with whoever is
 * steering, `rpc_move` puts a passenger where she is whatever the browser
 * says it walked to, and deep water holds nobody up who is on a deck.
 * `rpc_ground` says who is aboard each hull and whether her helm is as good
 * as empty, which is what a browser draws them from and what its menu offers.
 * A hull with people aboard is not picked up or turned; dying, or being
 * recalled to your token, leaves her; and recalled from her helm, the hull
 * stays where she is with the helm empty rather than going with you.
