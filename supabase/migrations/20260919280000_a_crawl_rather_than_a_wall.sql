-- Half again over the limit is a crawl rather than a wall
--
-- Asked for: change overburdened movement speed from 0% to 5%.
--
-- The nought was asked for too, a while back — "when inventory is above 150%
-- cap, movement speed becomes 0" — and it did the job it was given. What it
-- also did was leave a body that had overloaded itself with no way out of
-- wherever it was standing except to put things on the ground and leave them
-- there. A twentieth of a pace is still a wall by every measure that matters:
-- at a twentieth you are doing a tile every eight seconds, so nobody is
-- carrying a hill of ore home on it. But it is a wall you can creep along.
--
-- `carry_crawl()` is generated from `CARRY_CRAWL` in `src/game/player.ts`
-- beside `BASE_SPEED`, because that is where the speeds live and because the
-- browser must not be able to hold a different number to this one.
--
-- ---- and the slack has to come down with it -------------------------------
--
-- This is the line that decides how far the island will let a claimed walk
-- have got:
--
--     allowed := travel_speed(...) * least(gap, 10) * 1.6 + 1.5;
--
-- The `1.5` is slack for a link that hiccups, and it is the whole difficulty
-- here. Scale only the speed term and a body at a twentieth of its pace still
-- gets a tile and a half of grace on every call it makes — which, on a call a
-- walking browser makes several times a second, is not a crawl at all. It
-- would cross a field a hiccup at a time and the rule would read as broken by
-- exactly the people it is meant to slow down.
--
-- So the crawl multiplies the whole allowance, slack included. At a full pace
-- `crawl` is one and the line is the line it always was.
--
-- The browser is held to the same fraction in `Player.update`, and holds
-- itself to less than the island allows: at a half-second call and a base
-- pace of 2.4 tiles a second, the browser moves 0.06 of a tile and the island
-- would have allowed 0.195 — so a crawling body is never pulled back to where
-- it started, which would read as the old nought with extra steps.
--
-- ---- what does not change -------------------------------------------------
--
-- `carry_stop()` is where it was, at half again. The drag under it, the wind
-- it costs, the warning when you cross it — all as they were. And a body over
-- the line may still stand, work, and put things down, which is what it was
-- always allowed to do. This only concerns what is left of the walking.
