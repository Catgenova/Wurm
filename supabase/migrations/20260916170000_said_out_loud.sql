-- Every skill a wildermon teaches you, said out loud.
--
-- Reported as taming giving nothing for an attempt, "at least in chat". It was
-- giving something — `perform_creature` has called `skill_raise` on a refusal
-- since it was written, 0.35 of taming and 0.2 of soul strength — and nothing
-- ever said so.
--
-- Nine performers write "Digging increased by 0.6186 to 1.6186." out for
-- themselves. `perform_creature` was not one of them, so all eight of the
-- raises in it went up in silence: taming on a refusal, on a trust and on a
-- shearing, soul strength with the first two, animal husbandry off a
-- brushing, tailoring off a fleece, farming off a bucket. A number that moves
-- in a window with nothing to account for it reads as a number that has not
-- moved, which is exactly what was reported.
--
-- `skill_told` is that sentence in one place rather than a tenth copy of it,
-- and the other nine have something to come to when they are next touched.
--
-- And the line about coaxing still described the ceiling that came off it an
-- hour ago: "as used to you as it will get" from the fourth offering on, which
-- was true then and is not now.
