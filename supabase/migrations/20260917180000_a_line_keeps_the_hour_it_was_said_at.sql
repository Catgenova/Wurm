-- A line keeps the hour it was said at
--
-- Reported from the island: *"when logging in, all prior world chats default
-- to the login timestamp. Make them stick to the original timestamp of
-- entry."*
--
-- They did. Every line, wherever it came from, went through one door on the
-- browser side —
--
--     write(text, kind) { const entry = { time: Date.now(), text, kind }; ... }
--
-- — and `Date.now()` is when the line *arrived*, which for anything that
-- happened before you opened the page is the moment you opened the page. So a
-- morning's conversation read back as sixty lines all said at once, at the
-- second somebody logged in, and a chat you cannot scroll back through is not
-- a chat that was kept.
--
-- The hour was never lost. `event.at` has been on every row since the table
-- was written, and `rpc_chat` has been sending it since the day *it* was
-- written — the browser read the `n` and the `text` out of each line and let
-- the `at` fall on the floor. Three of the four ways a line reaches the log
-- already carried it:
--
--     rpc_chat          sent `at`, dropped by the browser
--     the Realtime row  the whole row, `at` and all, dropped by the browser
--     rpc_settle        did not send it                  <- this migration
--     this browser      has no `at`, because it is now, which is right
--
-- So this is the one end that had nothing to drop. `said` is the catch-up for
-- a channel that went quiet — lines that were said while nobody was listening,
-- which is exactly the set most likely to be minutes or hours old by the time
-- they land.

   * beat set `seen_at` to the same instant on every island you have ever

   * than a fact about you.
   *
   * The same answer carries the hour and the bars, so when the choice moved,
