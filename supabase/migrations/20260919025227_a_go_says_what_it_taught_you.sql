-- A go says what it taught you, wherever the go was.
--
-- Reported: "i'm not getting any smelting experience for failed smelting, not
-- sure if that's an oversight."
--
-- Half an oversight. The experience was there — a failed craft has paid
-- `try_gain(false)` of the trade since the day the rule was written, and a
-- crucible of bronze that would not take put smelting up from 1 to 1.2717 on
-- the island's own numbers while this was being looked into. What was missing
-- was anybody saying so. The line over the log is written by `skill_said`, and
-- `skill_said` was called by hand at the end of a performer: so a skill went up
-- silently everywhere the hand had not been.
--
-- It was not one place. `perform_craft` said nothing for a failed craft, which
-- is every recipe in the game and the one that was reported. `perform_forge`,
-- `perform_last`, `perform_item`, `perform_fight`, `perform_trap`,
-- `perform_dig` and `perform_faith` said nothing at all, hit or miss — so
-- improving a thing, brewing, taming, first aid, archery, every swing of a
-- weapon, breeding, alchemy, archaeology, prayer and meditation all raised a
-- number in silence. Twenty of the island's skill gains spoke and twenty-four
-- did not, and which was which was an accident of who wrote the performer.
--
-- So the telling moves inside the raise, which is where the browser has always
-- kept it: `gainSkill` raises the number and says what it was worth in one
-- place, and a caller cannot forget the second half because there is no second
-- half to forget. `skill_raise` now ends by saying it, the twenty-four
-- hand-written lines come out, and `skill_told` and `char_told` — which existed
-- only to pair the two — are what they say they are.
--
-- Which line it says is the skill's own business rather than the caller's, and
-- that is the other half the island did not have. A characteristic moves in
-- thousandths and is read as a whole number, so it speaks only when the whole
-- number moves; climbing and swimming are picked up on the way to somewhere
-- else and do the same. `skill_def.quiet` carries that, emitted from the
-- browser's own list, so the two sides cannot drift on which skills narrate
-- themselves.

alter table skill_def add column if not exists quiet boolean not null default false;

-- Said the way the browser says it: what it was worth and what it is now for a
-- trade, and for the quiet ones the whole number, only when it changes.
