/*
 * A field guide of the wildermon.
 *
 * Asked for: a field guide of the wildermon, one page per species, marking
 * whether you have seen, tamed and bred it, and where it lives.
 *
 * `guide` is the book: a row for each kind somebody has seen, with whether
 * they have tamed one and whether one has been born to them. Nothing on the
 * island reads it but the two doors below, and it is written in four places:
 *
 *   seen   `rpc_guide_seen`, which a browser calls with the kinds that have
 *          just come into its view: `guide_batch()` of them at most, no
 *          oftener than `GUIDE_EVERY` and the first the moment it is seen. A
 *          kind is taken only while a creature of it is standing out of a
 *          crate within `mobs_range()` of where the island has you, which is
 *          as far as a browser is told what is moving about and so as far as
 *          it can have seen anything: the book is not filled from a chair.
 *          Idempotent -- a kind already in the book is answered for and
 *          nothing is written.
 *   tamed  `perform_creature`, where an offering takes, and `perform_trap`,
 *          where a catch is got out of the noose: the two doors to keeping
 *          one, and both of them on the taming skill.
 *   bred   `give_birth`, for a young one born to a dam somebody keeps.
 *
 * A kind tamed or bred has been seen, so a row is made by any of the three,
 * and every row is a kind seen. So a sighting only ever inserts, and never has
 * to take a lock on a row that a birth or a taming may be writing.
 *
 * `rpc_guide` hands the whole book to its owner, once, as the window opens.
 * Row level security is on and nothing is granted: the doors are the only way
 * in, and each answers only for the one person asking.
 *
 * `guide_batch()` and `mobs_range()` are `GUIDE_BATCH` and `MOBS_RANGE` in
 * `src/game/keep.ts`, and come over with the definitions.
