/*
 * Packs, throwers and nerve; a companion's orders.
 *
 *   * A kind that runs in a pack (`species_def.pack`) takes the home of
 *     another of its kind within `herd_reach` when it comes into the world, no
 *     more than `pack_most` to a home, and keeps within `pack_range` of it.
 *     When one has your scent, each other of its kind within `pack_call` takes
 *     it too and follows the first (`pack_lead`). A pack on you spreads round
 *     you: each makes for its own side, an even share of the circle round from
 *     its leader, going round `circle_r` out until within `circle_arc` of it.
 *   * A thrower (`species_def.throws`) stands off `keep_off` and throws from up
 *     to `throw_reach` for `throw_hit` of a blow; nearer than `keep_off -
 *     back_slack` it backs away at `back_pace` of its walk, and fights hand to
 *     hand only with nowhere to back to.
 *   * A hunter turns tail below `turns_at` of its health, a coward
 *     (`species_def.coward`) also below `coward_drag` once another of its kind
 *     within `pack_call` has run, and a pack whose leader is dead or has run
 *     runs with it: away from you at `flee_pace` for `flee_secs`, and no
 *     interest in you for `hunt_rest`.
 *   * A companion can be set on what you are fighting (`order_attack`), called
 *     back to your side for `fall_back` seconds (`order_heel`, `heel_until`),
 *     or set to guard you: it goes for anything hunting you within
 *     `companion_sight` and keeps its fights within `guard_range` of you.
 *
 * The browser does all of it off the same names in `src/game/fight.ts`.
