-- A worker that finds a tile it cannot work has found nothing
--
-- `worker_settle` picks a tile of its trade, and for a trade worked from the
-- bank — a tree, a rod, a fruit bough, a rock face with water over it — it
-- then looks for somewhere beside it to stand. When there was nowhere it did
-- this:
--
--     c.until := c.until + interval '4 seconds';
--     continue;
--
-- and going round again re-derives the same tile. `find_work_tile` walks the
-- rings outward from the site and returns the first thing that passes; it has
-- no memory and waiting changes nothing about its answer. The only thing that
-- could change it is the ground. So a worker that reached this line stood
-- there for ever, four seconds at a time, and said nothing — which is the
-- shape of every bad hour this island has had lately, and the reason a day
-- went into guessing at a mola that turned out to be idle.
--
-- ---- and it is unreachable, which is why it is worth writing down ---------
--
-- `worker_gatherable` will not offer a tile that fails `face_reach`, and
-- `face_reach` is
--
--     creature_tile_ok(x, y)
--       or (centre_height(x, y) >= -mine_depth() and exists (beside_tile(x, y)))
--
-- so the only way to reach the branch — no standing on it — is the way that
-- guarantees a bank. The two cannot presently disagree, and I would rather
-- not find out which of them a later rule is added to. A retry that cannot
-- make progress is a spin whether or not anything can reach it today.
--
-- It leaves by the same door as finding nothing at all, because that is what
-- it is: the idle clock starts, and an hour of it is a word to the keeper
-- rather than a beast standing about for no reason anybody is told.
