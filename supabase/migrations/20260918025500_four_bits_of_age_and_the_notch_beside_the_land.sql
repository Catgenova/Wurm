-- Four bits of age, and the notch beside the land rather than in it
--
-- Asked from the island, all at once: a very old stage and a shrivelled one
-- at the end of a tree's life, a shrub that a sapling can be pruned into, and
-- a forester's rule that reads them. Every one of those is a stage, and a
-- tree's byte had room for four: species in the low nibble, the age in two
-- bits over it, and the felling notch in the two above that. Sapling took the
-- fourth value the day it was added. There was no fifth.
--
-- Of the two things sharing the byte, the notch was the one with somewhere
-- else to be. A half-felled tree is rare and brief — a stroke or two, then
-- either the tree comes down or the day closes the cut — and the byte is
-- every tree on every island. So the notch has a table now, `tree_notch`, one
-- row per half-felled tree and nothing for every other, and the age has all
-- four bits over the species: sixteen stages, four of which are spoken for.
--
-- ## What it keeps
--
-- The notch is still the tile's, not the woodcutter's. Walk away from a
-- half-felled oak and the row is still there for whoever comes by; a wildermon
-- set to fell cuts into the same row. A tile that stops being a tree forgets
-- its notch in `land_set_tile`, the one door every tile change goes through,
-- so nothing has to remember to. A day's growth closes every notch on the
-- island in one statement, as it always closed them by rewriting the byte.
--
-- ## What moves
--
-- Every half-felled tree standing anywhere, once: its two bits into the table
-- and the byte cleared to species and age. Counted and said aloud below. The
-- ages themselves do not move — young, mature, old and sapling are the same
-- four values they were, read through a wider mask — so a wood looks exactly
-- as it did the moment before, and a browser that has not been reloaded reads
-- every tree it can see the same way.
--
-- `tree_day` also learns to leave alone a stage it has no row for, or one
-- whose next stage is itself: a null in that expression would drop the byte
-- out of the line and shorten it, which is the kind of thing found by reading
-- rather than by running.
