/*
 * A fight on its own clock.
 *
 * Reported as bland and clunky, and it was one rhythm and it was yours: every
 * swing took the same two and a half seconds whatever was in your hand, a
 * creature answered each of your swings with a roll -- a swipe in on one in
 * three, every one for the defensive kinds -- and stood still otherwise, and
 * walking off left the swing-back queued to drag you back into it.
 *
 *   * A swing takes the weapon's own `swing` (`act_base`), and longer on tired
 *     arms: below `tired_at` wind, up to `tired_slow` longer with none left.
 *   * A swing or a draw costs `swing_wind` and `swing_wind_kg` more for every
 *     kilogram in the hand (`act_wind`), rather than one flat number.
 *   * Whatever you strike that does not bolt stands and fights
 *     (`engage_beast`): it comes at you through `hunt_settle` and lands its
 *     own blows every `blow_every` seconds while you are in reach, until you
 *     are `fight_give_up` tiles off or it has come `fight_leash` from where it
 *     was struck. The roll in `perform_fight` is gone.
 *   * A stance, kept on the body (`fight_stance`, `rpc_fight_prefs`): what you
 *     deal times `stance_dealt`, what reaches you times `stance_taken`.
 *   * `fight_back` is off when you say so (`fight_back`), and never while your
 *     feet have moved in the last `fight_back_still` seconds.
 *   * Walking off (`rpc_hold`) leaves a fight rather than keeping it for
 *     later, and a fight asked for (`rpc_act`) goes in hand at once with the
 *     work put to the front of the line, as a bite puts it.
 *
 * The browser does all of it off the same names in `src/game/fight.ts`.
