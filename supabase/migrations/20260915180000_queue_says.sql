-- The action bar's queue, one ask behind.
--
-- "On the action queue it never changes from 2/3 to 3/3 despite all 3 slots
-- filled." It never did, and it was not an off-by-one in the counting: the bar
-- draws `act_queue` plus the job in hand, which is right, but it only ever
-- *heard* about `act_queue` from `rpc_settle` — the heartbeat, and the moment a
-- job comes due. Never the moment one is added.
--
-- So the picture was always the state as of the last settle. Ask for a third
-- while two are running and the bar keeps saying "2 of 3"; the job in hand
-- finishes, a settle happens, one comes off the queue, and it says "2 of 3"
-- again. Top it up and it stays there for ever, which is what was seen.
--
-- The answer to an ask is where a browser should hear what the ask did. It
-- already said `inHand` and `capacity`; it says the list now, and the bar
-- redraws off the same words the log line is written from.
