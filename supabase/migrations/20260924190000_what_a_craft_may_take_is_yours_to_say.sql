/*
 * What a craft may take is the player's to say.
 *
 * Asked: "add a toggle in settings for allowing or disallowing crafting from
 * nearby containers. add another setting that disallows the automatic use of
 * any rare material in crafting." (And from the island's own chat, where it
 * came from: "a player setting to only use inventory".)
 *
 * Both are settings in the browser, kept with whoever is sitting there. The
 * island is what spends the stock -- a job is settled here, on the island's
 * clock, whether the browser is still open or not -- so it keeps its own copy
 * on the body, which `rpc_craft_prefs` sets when either is changed and at
 * the join.
 *
 *   craft_from_stores   false: a craft, and any work at a station that uses
 *                       something up, takes it from the pack and the bags on
 *                       your back and nowhere else. Otherwise the stores
 *                       within `craft_reach()` too, as since 20260924123000.
 *   craft_spare_rare    true: a rare, supreme or fantastic stack is never
 *                       picked by the work itself. It is spent only when the
 *                       work was pointed at that stack -- the stack a recipe
 *                       was started on, the fuel, clay, ore, scrap, casting
 *                       or lump named off a station's menu -- which is
 *                       `craft_stock`'s new `p_chosen`, carried through from
 *                       wherever the target names one.
 *
 * Null is "never said": the stores are used and the rare is not spared, which
 * is what the island did before, and the browser answers a null at the join
 * with whatever it has.
