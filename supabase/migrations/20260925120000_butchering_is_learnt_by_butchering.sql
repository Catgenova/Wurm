/*
 * Butchering: the skill rises with every carcass, and decides the quality of
 * what comes off it.
 *
 * Asked for: "Add the Butchering skill that gains experience from the
 * matching option. Butchering skill determines ql of Butchering output".
 *
 * The skill has been in the book since the start and the Butcher action has
 * always named it, but on an island a go at it never raised it: every other
 * performer calls `skill_raise` for its own trade, and the butcher branch of
 * `perform_fight` did not. A butcher on the island stayed at 1.00 for good.
 *
 * And the quality of what came off was the skill's product quality times
 * (0.6 + the corpse's quality / 250). A corpse comes down at 15 to 50 for a
 * grown animal, so that took everything down to 66 to 80 per cent of what the
 * skill made. It is now the skill's product quality with the knife and
 * nothing else, the same rule as every other trade. The log line says it.
