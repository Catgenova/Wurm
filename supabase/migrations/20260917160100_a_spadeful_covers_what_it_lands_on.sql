-- A spadeful of dirt covers over what it is dropped on
--
-- Reported from the island: *"dropping dirt on a clay/sand tile corner isn't
-- properly changing those tiles to dirt."* It was not. The rule named two
-- faces out loud —
--
--     if here in (0, 20) then land_set_tile(..., 1)
--
-- — grass and lawn, and nothing else. So a bank of clay took the spadeful,
-- rose a step, and stayed a bank of clay; the same for sand, peat, tar, marsh,
-- steppe, tundra and moss.
--
-- ## Which is the other half of a rule from this morning
--
-- Reported then: *"dropping dirt on sand or clay tiles converts them to dirt
-- tiles"*, and the fix was to stop `reconcile` doing it — a bed dug to the
-- rock and given one spadeful back used to come up Dirt, and the clay was gone
-- for good. That rule stands and is untouched here. The two are not in
-- tension; they are the difference between the ground tidying itself up and a
-- person with a shovel:
--
--     reconcile     leaves a bed alone     the ground never buries your clay
--     drop_dirt     buries it              because you told it to
--
-- A bed buried is still a bed gone — nothing anywhere remembers what was under
-- the dirt — but now it takes somebody choosing to do it.
--
-- ## And a list rather than two numbers
--
-- `buryable` is crossed from `BURYABLE` in the TypeScript, the way `plantable`
-- is, so the browser and the island cover over the same ground by
-- construction. The principle in it: a spadeful covers soft ground and what
-- grows flat on it — grass, lawn, steppe, tundra, moss, marsh — and the four
-- beds you dig out of, sand, clay, peat and tar. It does not cover paving,
-- which is broken up rather than buried; nor a crop, a tree or a bush, which
-- are standing on the tile; nor rock, which has no soil on it to be dirt.
--
-- Both spadefuls, because there are two and only one of them was ever asked
-- about. `drop_dirt` aims at a corner and covers the tile it names;
-- `drop_dirt_here` aims at your feet and covered nothing at all — it raised
-- the corner and left the face exactly as it was. It covers the tile you are
-- standing on now, off the same list.
