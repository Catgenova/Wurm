/*
 * The Mason moved onto perks: its eighteen, on the island.
 *
 * The third trade off its tree (`PERK_CLASSES`), after the Terraformer and the
 * Miner. Its perks are rows the definitions already carry (`class_perk`); what
 * is here is every rule they change, each reading its key off the fold with
 * the rule's own number as the default, so that for anybody without the perk
 * nothing moves:
 *
 *   * the chisel (`perform_craft`): Sure Chisel fails less, Three from a Shard
 *     and Good Mix make more of a thing a go -- and the go says how many --
 *     and Nothing Wasted keeps a failed smelter's or kiln's materials; Quick
 *     Chisel's time is the go's own (`time:` and the recipe);
 *   * the time of a go (`perk_time`, read by `rpc_act` and `settle`): the
 *     job's own key, and for building work the kind of work it is --
 *     `build_stone` for a wall or floor of stone, `bridge_stone` for a stone
 *     arch -- which is Quick Mason's and Bridge Mason's;
 *   * the trowel (`perform_building`): Two at a Time lays two units a go on
 *     stone, Hod Carrier builds out of the stores within its reach
 *     (`next_material`, `take_material`), Salvage gives back half the stone of
 *     a stone wall taken down, and a new job, Repoint, lays a finished stone
 *     wall again in another stone;
 *   * Tall Walls (`storey_cap`, `storey_capper`, `build_refusal`): every stone
 *     in a building planned by a Mason who took it stands two storeys taller,
 *     to twelve; `building.levels` may be as tall as that, and a storey past
 *     the tenth takes masonry 100 rather than more than there is;
 *   * the rock (`ground_refusal`, `perform_ground`): Concrete Hand never fails,
 *     Double Lift raises two steps where it may, Wet Set works under water,
 *     and a new job, Raise the rock with rubble, raises a step for shards;
 *   * Bridge Mason's longer stone arch (`bridge_reason`, which is asked with
 *     whose bridge it is now).
 *
 * Steep Stone's slope and Brick Porter's weights are read where the
 * Terraformer's were. The Mason's nodes go with its tree, and every Mason's
 * fold is written again.
