-- mentioned them, so a plan went up in Postgres, the rules answered about it,
-- and no browser ever drew a wall of it — a building invisible to everybody,
-- including whoever planned it.
--
-- And a worker whose keeper holds no settlement is turned loose, which is
-- right: the cap on how many you may keep is your settlement's level and it is
-- nought without one. Doing it without a word is not. Reported from the
-- island as a wildermon standing about on fifty tiles of forage it could have
