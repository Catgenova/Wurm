-- A browser that has just opened has missed nothing.
--
-- `rpc_settle` learned to carry the lines said while a Realtime channel was
-- down, counted from the highest the browser had heard. A browser that has
-- just opened has heard none and sends a nought, and `e.n > 0` is every line
-- on the island — so a refresh replayed the oldest sixty, starting at "You
-- wash ashore on an untouched island with a few tools and your wits", and the
-- beat after that replayed the next sixty.
--
-- Measured before it was touched: a body three lines old was handed all three,
-- oldest first, on its first beat.
--
-- A nought now means "I have just got here", and the mark to count from comes
-- back in its place. The backlog of talk is `rpc_chat`'s, which a joining
-- browser already asks for and which answers the question somebody actually
-- has: what was said before I arrived.

   * Which island this is a heartbeat for, settled before anything is written.
   *
   * It used to be `order by seen_at desc limit 1` over every row with your uid
   * on it, and the update above it had no world in its `where` either — so one
   * beat set `seen_at` to the same instant on every island you have ever
   * joined, and then picked between them with a sort that had nothing left to
   * sort by. Three rows, one timestamp, no tie-break: the answer is whichever
   * one Postgres happens to hand back, and that is a choice of plan rather
   * than a fact about you.
   *
   * The same answer carries the hour and the bars, so when the choice moved,
   * both moved together — reported as "occasionally it switches randomly to
   * nighttime and hunger/thirst plummet until refreshed". A refresh put it
   * right because `rpc_join` names its island, and the next beat broke it
   * again because this one did not.
   *
   * So the browser says where it is standing. `rpc_settle` was the only door
   * of the twenty that did not take a `p_world`, and it is the one that runs
   * every minute of every session.
