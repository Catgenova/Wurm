-- A sprout planted under your own feet.
--
-- A tree is the one tile on this island that nothing can stand on, and `plant`
-- turns the ground into one. It never asked where the planter was standing, so
-- planting the sprout you are stood on walled you in: the tile you occupied
-- became impassable with you inside it, and the only way out was to chop the
-- tree you had just put there back down.
--
-- The browser had the same hole, in the same shape, and the same words go in
-- both places. The refusal is the courtesy; the cure is in the legs, where a
-- body that finds itself somewhere it should not be can now walk out of it
-- however it got there — which is what covers the other ways in, a tile change
-- arriving from the island among them.
