-- A read that was doing the island's thinking
--
-- Reported: the game itself comes up in ten seconds, the deed and the
-- buildings take five minutes, and the wildlife has not arrived after ten.
--
-- Three different waits out of one island means one thing is eating the
-- connections and everything else is queued behind it. Measured here, on the
-- same island, same player, same second:
--
--     rpc_ground    2.7 ms a call
--     rpc_creatures 257 - 466 ms a call
--
-- `rpc_creatures` is a read. It was calling `creature_sweep`, which settles
-- every creature within forty tiles whose turn has come — up to a hundred and
-- twenty of them, each one a piece of animal thinking and some of it pathing
-- — on the call a browser makes every second, per player, while that browser
-- sits there waiting.
--
-- PostgREST answers eight at a time. Two people looking at wildlife is two of
-- those eight held for half a second each, over and over, and everything else
-- the island is asked — the deed, the buildings, the ground — waits its turn
-- behind them. That is the five minutes.
--
-- ---- and it was already being done ---------------------------------------
--
-- `world_tick` takes the same list of live bodies, dedupes them onto their
-- tiles, and sweeps forty tiles round each one, once a second, on a clock
-- nobody is waiting for. The sweep in the read was the same work a second
-- time, on the worst thread in the island to do it on.
--
-- So it comes out, and the wildlife goes on being settled by the clock that
-- was already settling it. Where there is no `pg_cron` there is no other
-- clock and it still happens on the read — the suite's bare postgres and any
-- project without the extension behave exactly as they did. That is the same
-- guard, for the same reason, as the stocking two commits ago.
--
-- This is the third time tonight the same fault has turned up: work with no
-- business on a request path, sitting on it. The walk call was putting the
-- wildlife out; this read was doing the wildlife's thinking. Both are the
-- clock's job.

   * is why an island would hand over a deed in a few seconds and its wildlife
