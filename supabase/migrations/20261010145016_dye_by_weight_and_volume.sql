-- Dye by weight and by volume, and a choice of the dye a dyeing draws from.
--
-- `src/game/dyes.ts` and `src/game/dyestuffs.ts` are the rules; this is the
-- island's half of them, and `supabase/test/dyes.ts` holds the two together.
--
-- A boil takes a kilo of its dyestuff, by the items' own weights, for every
-- litre of lye in the bucket (`dye_litres_per_kg()` litres a kilo, more for a
-- Naturalist's Double Boil, `litres:dye`; a share of the weight for a Thrifty
-- Dyer, `need:` and the recipe), uses the fewest whole items that weigh that
-- much, says what it used, and leaves as many litres of dye as there was lye
-- (`dye_boil_litres()`). Short of the weight it says how many kilos it takes
-- and how many you have. A bauble adds no go to a boil: its bucket is full.
--
-- A dyeing takes the litres in `dye_litres_def` out of one source: a bucket of
-- dye loose in the pack, or a barrel of dye within the reach a craft has into
-- the stores around you (`craft_reach()`, yours or on a settlement of yours,
-- not locked against you). The one chosen travels on the target as `dyeFrom`
-- (`item:<id>` or `furniture:<id>`); with none chosen, the only one that holds
-- enough, or the first of them. None holding enough is refused with the litres
-- it takes and the most any one holds.
--
-- The functions rewritten whole below are each taken from the newest migration
-- that defined it, which is named above it.
