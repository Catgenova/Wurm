-- A team stays in the traces
--
-- Asked: "hitching wildermon to the wagon doesn't seem to be working. fix so
-- that they are hitched until unhitched, that all permissions for vehicles are
-- open by default, and that hitched wildermon are free from enemy aggressive
-- targeting and do not get hungry as long as they're hitched".
--
-- ## Hitched, and then walked off
--
-- `hitch_up` has always written `hitched_to`, and the suite has always read it
-- back. Nothing else did. `creature_settle` runs for every creature near a
-- player once a second, and it went on doing what it does for a companion --
-- stand it at its keeper's feet -- and for a worker -- send it out to its
-- trade. So a wildermon backed into a yoke was at its owner's heels on the
-- next beat, or off foraging, with `hitched_to` still naming a wagon it was
-- nowhere near. Its belly went on emptying at its mode's rate the whole time,
-- and ringing the bell called a hitched worker off the shafts like any other.
--
-- It stands at the vehicle now and thinks nothing. The body is still settled
-- -- wounds close, a fleece grows back, a brushing wears off -- but its hunger
-- holds where it was when it went in, and feeding it still fills it. The only
-- things that take it out are `unhitch_one` and `unhitch_all`, and the vehicle
-- itself going, which leaves nothing to be in the traces of. Taking it out
-- settles it first, while it is still in harness: a settle only comes round
-- for a creature near somebody, and the first one after it came out would
-- otherwise have billed its belly for every hour it stood in the traces.
--
-- ## And the browser was never told
--
-- `rpc_creatures` carried no hitch at all, so on an island every hitched
-- animal read as free: the menu offered to hitch it again and never to take it
-- out, and the wagon's yokes read empty. It carries `hitchedTo` now. Asked to
-- hitch one already in harness, the island says so, where `hitch_up` used to
-- refuse in silence; asked to take out one that is not in, it says that; and
-- sending one in harness to work, to the token, to you, back to the wild or to
-- a post is refused in words, which the browser did already and the island did
-- not.
--
-- ## Nothing picks one in the traces to fight
--
-- As it stands nothing wild goes for a tame animal on this island -- a hunter
-- goes for people -- and what a companion or a guard goes for is always wild.
-- The three places a fight picks its quarry now ask that it is not in harness
-- as well, so a hitched animal is nobody's target whatever else is true of it.
--
-- ## Whose a vehicle is
--
-- Nothing asks. Taking the reins, taking hold of a cart, hitching to one and
-- taking a beast out of it, unhitching the team, loading it, emptying it and
-- picking it up are open to anybody standing at it, whoever built it and
-- whoever's ground it stands on. There was nothing to open; `traces.ts` asks
-- all of it of somebody who did not build the wagon, so that it stays open.
