/*
 * The Carpenter moved onto perks: its eighteen, on the island.
 *
 * The fourth trade off its tree (`PERK_CLASSES`). Its perks are rows the
 * definitions already carry (`class_perk`); what is here is every rule they
 * change, each reading its key off the fold with the rule's own number as the
 * default, so that for anybody without the perk nothing moves:
 *
 *   * the saw and the bench (`perform_craft`): Quick Saw's and Shipwright's
 *     time is the go's own (`time:` and the recipe, in `perk_time`); Clean
 *     Sawing, Heavy Timber and Thatcher make more a go (`count:`); Sure Hull
 *     and String Maker fail less (`fail:`); String Maker takes one yarn where
 *     the recipe says two (`need:`, `recipe_need`, here and in
 *     `craft_refusal`); and Master Joiner rolls the first step of rarity at
 *     better odds on the joinery (`rare:`);
 *   * a maker's mark: what a Carpenter makes carries their Deep Drawers, Keel
 *     Layer, Deep Hold, Smooth Axle, Bowyer's Draw and True Bow in a `mark`
 *     on the item (`made_mark`), which goes with it onto the ground when it is
 *     set down and back into the pack when it is picked up, and which the
 *     rules it changes read (`mark_of`): what a piece holds, how fast a boat
 *     or a wagon goes, what a bow hits for and how far it throws;
 *   * the tool (`wear_tool`): Saw Care's saws, carving knives, mallets and
 *     files wear half as much -- and the bench wears the tool at all now, a go
 *     at a time, as the browser always has (`Game.act`). The island's bench
 *     never did: a saw sawed for ever, and a perk that spared it would have
 *     spared nothing;
 *   * fences (`perform_building`, `perk_time`): Fence Builder plans a fence,
 *     a gate or a half wall for half its material and builds it in half the
 *     time a go;
 *   * Timber Salvage (`remove_wall`, the Mason's `salvage:` on wood) and
 *     Bridge Wright (`perk_time` and `bridge_reason`, the Mason's `span:`)
 *     needed nothing but their rows.
 *
 * The Carpenter's nodes go with its tree, and every Carpenter's fold is
 * written again.
