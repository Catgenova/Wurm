-- Look says what a tree is, what is in it, what is coming, and what to do
--
-- Asked from the island: Look shows the age and what is next — "an old oak,
-- will be gone in nine hours; prune it to keep it". The hour was always on
-- the island, `world.trees_at`, and the notch beside the land; nothing had
-- been told to say them.
--
-- So a tree reads, on both sides and in the same words: what it is; how many
-- strokes are in it, if any; when the woods turn over and what it will be
-- then; and, where it matters, what to do about that — prune it to keep it,
-- when the next stage is dead, or fell it for what timber is in it, when it
-- is dead already. A clipped shrub has nothing coming, and says so. A stump
-- says dig it out or leave it a day, as it has since it was a tile.
--
-- A browser on an island keeps no clock of its own for the woods, so the
-- ground read's slow half now carries how long ago they last turned over,
-- and the felling notches near the body with it. `hours_hence` and
-- `tree_outlook` are the sentence, written once here and once in the browser
-- under the same names, and measured to agree.
