-- A leg the browser can draw without agreeing what time it is.
--
-- The other half of "them jumping around due to the server movement". The
-- wandering itself is slowed in the migration before this one; this is the
-- part that would still have jumped with a beast standing perfectly still.
--
-- `rpc_creatures` handed over `leg_at` and `leg_ends` as instants, and the
-- browser parsed them against its own clock. Twenty seconds of skew — which a
-- phone can easily carry — pins every leg at one end or the other, and each
-- answer re-pins it somewhere new. The action bar learnt this months ago and
-- takes seconds rather than timestamps for exactly this reason; the wildlife
-- never did.
