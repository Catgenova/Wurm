/*
 * Gravel is retired, and what was laid in it becomes cobblestone.
 *
 * Tile 13 was gravel: a heap of crushed rock spread over packed earth, the
 * cheap paving and the ugly one. There was no work in it and it looked like
 * there was no work in it -- thirty chips scattered over a lozenge -- and
 * beside a cobbled road it read as grit. Cobblestone does the job it was
 * there to do and does it properly, so gravel goes and the ground that was
 * laid in it is relaid.
 *
 * Three things have to happen together, in this order, or an island is
 * briefly wrong: the ground already stored as thirteen becomes fourteen, the
 * chunk cache that remembers those rows is thrown away, and the rules stop
 * offering and stop performing `pave_gravel`. The tile and action definition
 * rows go with the next generated defs, which truncate and rewrite them.
 *
 * Old history is mended as well. `tile_change` rows are replayed by anybody
 * joining, and a row that lays a thirteen would lay a tile that no longer
 * exists, which draws as nothing and walks like nothing. The browser turns a
 * thirteen into cobblestone wherever one arrives -- see `layChange` and
 * `layRows` in src/net/landpack.ts -- but a client that is a version behind
 * is not owed a road full of holes, so the rows are mended here too.
