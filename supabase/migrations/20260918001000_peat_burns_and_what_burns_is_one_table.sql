-- Peat burns, and what burns is one table now
--
-- Asked from the island: *"allow peat as fuel."*
--
-- Peat is the one thing here that is dug straight out of the ground and is
-- worth nothing at all. There is a bed of it, a shovel that fills off the top
-- of one, and a `bogga` whose entire trade is "cut peat and tar and carry them
-- home" — and then nowhere for any of it to go. Three minutes in the fire,
-- which is longer than a plank, well short of a timber and a fifth of a charge
-- of coal; the reasoning is written out over the table in `campfire.ts`.
--
-- ## And why this migration is two lines of rules and no numbers
--
-- `fuel_value()` was typed out by hand on this side, in three separate
-- migrations, beside a `FUEL_VALUES` in `campfire.ts` that said the same six
-- things. Two copies of one table, kept level by whoever remembered.
--
-- What that arrangement produces, when it finally slips, is not an error
-- anybody can read: the browser offers a fire something the island will not
-- burn, so you hold a thing the window says is fuel and the fire quietly does
-- not take it. Nothing is logged, nothing throws, and the only symptom is that
-- it does not work.
--
-- So `fuel_value()` and `fuel_said()` are generated from the browser's table
-- now, like every other number on this island, and arrive in the `_defs`
-- migration beside this one. What is left here is the two rules that had the
-- list written out in *words* — "shafts, thatch, planks, timbers, logs or
-- coal", which was six things because the table held six, and would have gone
-- on saying six. They ask `fuel_said()` for the sentence.
