-- Three answers that said more than they had to.
--
-- ## The ground, which is two things at two speeds
--
-- A fire burns down and a kiln works through its load while you stand and
-- watch, which is why `rpc_ground` is asked for every second. A wall is not
-- like that: it goes up when somebody builds it and then it is a wall.
--
-- Both went at the same pace, so every second, for every player, the island
-- ran a correlated subquery over `building_tile` for each building in range,
-- a scan of `wall`, a scan of `floor_tile` and two passes over `deed` — to
-- report that the house is still a house.
--
-- The caller says which half it wants now. A browser asks for the lot on its
-- twenty-second reconcile and after any of its own work, and for the burning
-- half the rest of the time. `p_slow` defaults true, so a page that has not
-- been redeployed gets exactly what it always got.
--
-- ## The skills, which were sent whole to say nothing
--
-- `rpc_settle` aggregated the entire book — every skill, every beat — to hand
-- back the same forty numbers it handed back last time. `skill_raise` stamps
-- the player now, so a beat where nothing moved leaves the key out and a beat
-- where something did costs exactly what it always did.
--
-- ## And the talk, which had no way to be caught up on
--
-- Every other table the browser reads has a cursor. `event` did not: lines
-- arrive over Realtime and a channel that dropped for a moment loses them for
-- good. It carries the highest `n` it has seen now and gets whatever is newer,
-- so a dropped line is twenty seconds late instead of gone.
--
-- ## Left out, not emptied
--
-- All three are absent from the answer rather than sent as nothing, and the
-- browser applies only the keys it is given — `sawGround` already worked that
-- way for buildings. `jsonb_strip_nulls` on the way out is what makes the
-- absence mean "nothing to say" rather than "there is none of this".
