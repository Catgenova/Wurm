-- A companion at heel fights
--
-- Reported: "Aggressive and defensive wildermon companions don't attack".
-- While a browser is on an island the island owns the wildlife, and the
-- island's whole rule for a companion was to stand it at its keeper's feet
-- on every settle. The browser has a rule for what a companion does about
-- company (`updateActive`: an aggressive one goes for anything wild within
-- five tiles of you, a defensive one answers what has struck at it or at
-- you in the last eight seconds), and it never runs while the island owns
-- the wildlife. So neither stance did anything at all.
--
-- The rule is here now. `companion_target` says what it goes for, off the
-- browser's numbers (`companion_sight`, `companion_leash`, `companion_reach`,
-- `companion_blow`, `companion_pace`, `blow_memory`, generated in the defs
-- before this), and `companion_settle` walks and strikes the way a deed
-- worker's fight does, from `creature_settle`, which now leaves a fighting
-- companion the legs it has rather than standing it back at heel.
--
-- And two things found on the way. The swipe a cornered animal gets in when
-- you hit it (`perform_fight`) hurt you without marking you as struck, so a
-- defensive companion had nothing to answer; it marks you now, as a hunter's
-- bite always did. And a kill is told to the keeper standing next to it
-- (`wound_beast`), the way the browser says "killed a wild rabba". The deed
-- worker's memory of a blow (`fight_target`) reads the same `blow_memory`
-- the companion's does, rather than its own eight seconds.

/*
 * What a companion at heel goes for, if anything: the question `fight_target`
 * answers for a worker on a deed, asked about the ground round its keeper
 * rather than round the token.
 *
 * Nothing while it is passive, and nothing while its keeper is away, because
 * a fight nobody is there for is not one. What it already has in its teeth,
 * while that is still wild and still within the leash of its keeper.
 * Otherwise, for an aggressive one, the nearest wild thing within sight of
 * its keeper; for a defensive one, whatever struck at it, or failing that at
 * its keeper, inside the memory of a blow — and only something wild, because
 * a worker of your own that nipped you is not a fight for it.
