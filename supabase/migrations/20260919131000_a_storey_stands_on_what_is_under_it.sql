-- A storey stands on what is under it, and a cart wants a wider door
--
-- Three rules about what may be built, all of them things the game had never
-- had an opinion about.
--
-- A building could be ten storeys of logs. Nothing anywhere asked what the
-- stuff would stand, so a log tower and a marble one were the same tower with
-- a different picture on it, and the twelve materials differed only in what
-- they cost and what colour they came out. Each of them says now how many
-- storeys of it will stand — three for logs, four for planks, up to the ten
-- the world allows for cut and mortared stone — and the shortest material
-- anywhere in a building caps the whole of it, because a building comes down
-- as one thing.
--
-- And a storey may not be heavier than what carries it. Three grades, because
-- three is what anybody holds in their head while they are planning: timber,
-- which anything takes; brick, rubble and rammed earth; and cut stone, which
-- only cut stone will bear. A marble storey over a log one is a roof looking
-- for somewhere to fall, and you are told so at the planning rather than left
-- to find out.
--
-- And the hands: ten points of the trade below for every storey above the
-- first, so the second wants ten and the tenth wants ninety. Masonry and
-- carpentry were skills you trained by building and never needed in order to
-- build; there is a reason to have them now.
--
-- The cart half of it is the browser's own — the island has never had an
-- opinion about where wheels may go — so it is not here. What is here is the
-- `wide` flag the browser reads, which comes across with the rulebook.
