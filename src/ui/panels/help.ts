    <p>Drag a window by its title bar and resize it from the bottom-right corner. The layout is remembered.</p>
    <h3>Settling and building</h3>
    <p>Use the settlement deed in your inventory to found a settlement where you stand: an 11 by 11
    square around a stone token. You may hold one settlement at a time, and building is only allowed
    on its land. Things left outside on deed land rot ten times slower.</p>
    <p>To build, flatten and pack a tile, then with a mallet choose <b>Plan building</b> on it and
    <b>Add to building</b> on neighbouring flat packed tiles. Point at a tile's edge and <b>Plan wall</b>
    there: solid, window, bay window, door or double door, in log, plank, timbercraft, cobblestone,
    slate, marble, sandstone, stone brick, clay adobe, clay bricks, ornate silver or ornate gold. Then
    <b>Build wall</b> feeds it materials one at a time. Floors are planned the same way and laid with
    the paving skill. Another storey can only be planned once every wall of the storey below is built.
    On an upper storey, plan a <b>staircase</b> or <b>ladder</b> instead of a plain floor to climb up:
    walk onto it from below and you are upstairs, step off it toward the ground and you are down again.
    Once the top storey's walls are done you can <b>Plan roof</b> tile by tile; neighbouring roof tiles
    join into ridges and hips.</p>
    <p>Materials: saw logs into planks and timbers, bundle cut grass into thatch, mix clay and sand
    into mortar, chisel rock, slate, marble and sandstone shards into bricks, shape clay into bricks
    or press it with grass into adobe, and chip silver and gold from veins in the mountains.</p>
    <h3>Wildermon</h3>
    <p>Wild creatures roam the island. The first is the <b>Rabba</b>, a rabbit-like grazer that forages
    berries when hungry (and picks that spot clean for a while). Carry a berry or vegetable, long-press
    or right-click one and choose <b>Tame</b>: the food is used up, success is uncommon at low taming
    skill, and a Rabba never holds a failed attempt against you.</p>
    <p>A tamed wildermon either <b>travels with you</b> (one at a time; its stance is Passive, Defensive
    or Aggressive) or is <b>assigned to your deed</b>, where a Rabba forages around the settlement and
    drops what it finds in the deed crate beside the token. Extra tamed wildermon are kept at the token,
    whose menu lists them. Feed them from your pack; deed workers help themselves from the crate.
    The <b>Wildermon</b> window (<kbd>P</kbd>) shows the condition, level and skills of every creature
    you own; wild ones keep theirs to themselves. Deed workers learn from their work, gaining skill at
    half a player's pace and working at half a player's speed, and better skill means better quality
    finds and quicker work.</p>
    <p>Every tile is a 4 by 4 grid of spots for placing things. Build a <b>log crate</b> from three
    logs or a <b>plank crate</b> from six planks (with a mallet), then right-click the spot on a tile
    where you want it; it snaps to the grid. Crates hold 30 or 60 things, can be opened, emptied and
    picked up again when empty. The deed crate beside the token is one of them.</p>
    <p>Grass tells you what it holds: berries among the tufts mean it can be foraged, flowers mean it
    can be botanized, and grazed-bare grass has been picked over and needs time to recover.</p>
    <h3>Terraforming</h3>
    <p>Digging lowers the corner nearest to where you click (the small marker) and gives you dirt.
    Drop dirt to raise a corner. Flatten evens a tile out step by step. Mine rock with a pickaxe,
    then pave gravel with the shards or chisel them into bricks for cobblestone.</p>
    <p>Dropped items lie where you stood; the tile's menu offers to pick them up again. Anything
    left outside slowly decays, even while you are away: food rots within the hour, stone lasts for
    days, and better quality holds up longer. Fill your water skin at any shore and drink from it on
    the road.</p>
    <p>Your skills rise with everything you do. Better skill means faster, more successful actions and
    the freedom to shape steeper slopes.</p>
